Subject: [PATCH 106/351] sched: Limit the number of task migrations per batch
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=c8d0aca09270aaacbb5a4ffd4e9e42e9cf28531a

Put an upper limit on the number of tasks which are migrated per batch
to avoid large latencies.
