Subject: [PATCH 106/353] sched: Limit the number of task migrations per batch
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=8cce7045319b606fb508c6c135bc17fec1297dea

Put an upper limit on the number of tasks which are migrated per batch
to avoid large latencies.
