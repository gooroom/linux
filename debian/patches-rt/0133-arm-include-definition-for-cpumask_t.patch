Subject: [PATCH 133/325] arm: include definition for cpumask_t
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.19/older/patches-4.19.115-rt48.tar.xz

This definition gets pulled in by other files. With the (later) split of
RCU and spinlock.h it won't compile anymore.
The split is done in ("rbtree: don't include the rcu header").
