Subject: [PATCH 133/353] arm: include definition for cpumask_t
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=2e5ee101b7130830a24ba3159856ad5b8d247616

This definition gets pulled in by other files. With the (later) split of
RCU and spinlock.h it won't compile anymore.
The split is done in ("rbtree: don't include the rcu header").
