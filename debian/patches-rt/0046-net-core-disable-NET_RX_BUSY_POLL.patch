Subject: [PATCH 046/353] net/core: disable NET_RX_BUSY_POLL
MIME-Version: 1.0

sk_busy_loop() does preempt_disable() followed by a few operations which can
take sleeping locks and may get long.
I _think_ that we could use preempt_disable_nort() (in sk_busy_loop()) instead
but after a successfull cmpxchg(&napi->state, â€¦) we would gain the ressource
and could be scheduled out. At this point nobody knows who (which context) owns
it and so it could take a while until the state is realeased and napi_poll()
could be invoked again.
