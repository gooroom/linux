Subject: [PATCH 147/290] rtmutex/rwlock: preserve state like a sleeping lock
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.19/older/patches-4.19.94-rt38.tar.xz

The rwlock is spinning while acquiring a lock. Therefore it must become
a sleeping lock on RT and preserve its task state while sleeping and
waiting for the lock to become available.
