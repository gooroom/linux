Subject: x86: i8259: Add missing include file

From: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>

commit 0a957467c5fd46142bc9c52758ffc552d4c5e2f7 upstream.

i8259.h uses inb/outb and thus needs to include asm/io.h to avoid the
following build error, as seen with x86_64:defconfig and CONFIG_SMP=n.

  In file included from drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.c:45:0:
  arch/x86/include/asm/i8259.h: In function 'inb_pic':
  arch/x86/include/asm/i8259.h:32:24: error:
	implicit declaration of function 'inb'

  arch/x86/include/asm/i8259.h: In function 'outb_pic':
  arch/x86/include/asm/i8259.h:45:2: error:
	implicit declaration of function 'outb'
