Subject: ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: Enable both RGMII RX/TX delay on Ethernet PHY
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/57dbe558457bf4042169bc1f334e3b53a8480a1c
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/973369

The Ethernet PHY on the Bananapi M3 and Cubietruck Plus have the RX
and TX delays enabled on the PHY, using pull-ups on the RXDLY and
TXDLY pins.

Fix the phy-mode description to correct reflect this so that the
implementation doesn't reconfigure the delays incorrectly. This
happened with commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e
rx/tx delay config").
