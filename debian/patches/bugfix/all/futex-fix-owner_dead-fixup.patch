Subject: [PATCH 1/9] futex: Fix OWNER_DEAD fixup

commit a97cb0e7b3f4c6297fd857055ae8e895f402f501 upstream.

Both Geert and DaveJ reported that the recent futex commit:

  c1e2f0eaf015 ("futex: Avoid violating the 10th rule of futex")

introduced a problem with setting OWNER_DEAD. We set the bit on an
uninitialized variable and then entirely optimize it away as a
dead-store.

Move the setting of the bit to where it is more useful.
