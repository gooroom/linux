Subject: [19/26] powerpc/fsl: Fix spectre_v2 mitigations reporting
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit?id=1eb1ddbdf5c019d90c690495dc545696c86ed3ce

commit 7d8bad99ba5a22892f0cad6881289fdc3875a930 upstream.

Currently for CONFIG_PPC_FSL_BOOK3E the spectre_v2 file is incorrect:

  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2
  "Mitigation: Software count cache flush"

Which is wrong. Fix it to report vulnerable for now.

Fixes: ee13cb249fab ("powerpc/64s: Add support for software count cache flush")
