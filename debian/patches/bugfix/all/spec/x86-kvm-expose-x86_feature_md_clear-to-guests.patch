Subject: x86/kvm: Expose X86_FEATURE_MD_CLEAR to guests

commit 6c4dbbd14730c43f4ed808a9c42ca41625925c22 upstream.

X86_FEATURE_MD_CLEAR is a new CPUID bit which is set when microcode
provides the mechanism to invoke a flush of various exploitable CPU buffers
by invoking the VERW instruction.

Hand it through to guests so they can adjust their mitigations.

This also requires corresponding qemu changes, which are available
separately.
