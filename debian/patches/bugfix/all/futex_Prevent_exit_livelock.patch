Subject: futex: Prevent exit livelock

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit 3ef240eaff36b8119ac9e2ea17cbf41179c930ba upstream

Oleg provided the following test case:

int main(void)
{
	struct sched_param sp = {};

	sp.sched_priority = 2;
	assert(sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_FIFO, &sp) == 0);

	int lock = vfork();
	if (!lock) {
		sp.sched_priority = 1;
		assert(sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_FIFO, &sp) == 0);
		_exit(0);
	}

	syscall(__NR_futex, &lock, FUTEX_LOCK_PI, 0,0,0);
	return 0;
}

This creates an unkillable RT process spinning in futex_lock_pi() on a UP
machine or if the process is affine to a single CPU. The reason is:

 parent	    	    			child

  set FIFO prio 2

  vfork()			->	set FIFO prio 1
   implies wait_for_child()	 	sched_setscheduler(...)
 			   		exit()
					do_exit()
 					....
					mm_release()
					  tsk->futex_state = FUTEX_STATE_EXITING;
					  exit_futex(); (NOOP in this case)
					  complete() --> wakes parent
  sys_futex()
    loop infinite because
    tsk->futex_state == FUTEX_STATE_EXITING

The same problem can happen just by regular preemption as well:

  task holds futex
  ...
  do_exit()
    tsk->futex_state = FUTEX_STATE_EXITING;

  --> preemption (unrelated wakeup of some other higher prio task, e.g. timer)

  switch_to(other_task)

  return to user
  sys_futex()
	loop infinite as above

Just for the fun of it the futex exit cleanup could trigger the wakeup
itself before the task sets its futex state to DEAD.

To cure this, the handling of the exiting owner is changed so:

   - A refcount is held on the task

   - The task pointer is stored in a caller visible location

   - The caller drops all locks (hash bucket, mmap_sem) and blocks
     on task::futex_exit_mutex. When the mutex is acquired then
     the exiting task has completed the cleanup and the state
     is consistent and can be reevaluated.

This is not a pretty solution, but there is no choice other than returning
an error code to user space, which would break the state consistency
guarantee and open another can of problems including regressions.

For stable backports the preparatory commits ac31c7ff8624 .. ba31c1a48538
are required as well, but for anything older than 5.3.y the backports are
going to be provided when this hits mainline as the other dependencies for
those kernels are definitely not stable material.
