Subject: mm: hugetlb: allow hugepages_supported to be architecture specific
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/2531c8cf56a640cd7d17057df8484e570716a450

s390 has a constant hugepage size, by setting HPAGE_SHIFT we also change
e.g. the pageblock_order, which should be independent in respect to
hugepage support.

With this patch every architecture is free to define how to check
for hugepage support.
