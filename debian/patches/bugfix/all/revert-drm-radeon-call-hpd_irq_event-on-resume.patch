Subject: Revert "drm/radeon: call hpd_irq_event on resume"
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/256faedcfd646161477d47a1a78c32a562d2e845

This reverts commit dbb17a21c131eca94eb31136eee9a7fe5aff00d9.

It turns out that commit can cause problems for systems with multiple
GPUs, and causes X to hang on at least a HP Pavilion dv7 with hybrid
graphics.

This got noticed originally in 4.4.4, where this patch had already
gotten back-ported, but 4.5-rc7 was verified to have the same problem.

Alexander Deucher says:
 "It looks like you have a muxed system so I suspect what's happening is
  that one of the display is being reported as connected for both the
  IGP and the dGPU and then the desktop environment gets confused or
  there some sort problem in the detect functions since the mux is not
  switched to the dGPU.  I don't see an easy fix unless Dave has any
  ideas.  I'd say just revert for now"
