Subject: irda: Fix memory leak caused by repeated binds of irda socket
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=ce54bf4aec595c479b462180d682783b3776fb80
Bug-Debian-Security: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6554

The irda_bind() function allocates memory for self->ias_obj without
checking to see if the socket is already bound. A userspace process
could repeatedly bind the socket, have each new object added into the
LM-IAS database, and lose the reference to the old object assigned to
the socket to exhaust memory resources. This patch errors out of the
bind operation when self->ias_obj is already assigned.

CVE-2018-6554

Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")
