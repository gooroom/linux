Subject: bpf/verifier: Fix states_equal() comparison of pointer and UNKNOWN

An UNKNOWN_VALUE is not supposed to be derived from a pointer, unless
pointer leaks are allowed.  Therefore, states_equal() must not treat
a state with a pointer in a register as "equal" to a state with an
UNKNOWN_VALUE in that register.

This was fixed differently upstream, but the code around here was
largely rewritten in 4.14 by commit f1174f77b50c "bpf/verifier: rework
value tracking".  The bug can be detected by the bpf/verifier sub-test
"pointer/scalar confusion in state equality check (way 1)".
