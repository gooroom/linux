Subject: irda: Only insert new objects into the global database via setsockopt
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=18d94895f505d6eef2da8868e87a403cde1d9ef0
Bug-Debian-Security: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6555

The irda_setsockopt() function conditionally allocates memory for a new
self->ias_object or, in some cases, reuses the existing
self->ias_object. Existing objects were incorrectly reinserted into the
LM_IAS database which corrupted the doubly linked list used for the
hashbin implementation of the LM_IAS database. When combined with a
memory leak in irda_bind(), this issue could be leveraged to create a
use-after-free vulnerability in the hashbin list. This patch fixes the
issue by only inserting newly allocated objects into the database.

CVE-2018-6555
