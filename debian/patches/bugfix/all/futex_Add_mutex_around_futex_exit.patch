Subject: futex: Add mutex around futex exit
From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
Date: Wed Nov  6 22:55:44 2019 +0100

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit 3f186d974826847a07bc7964d79ec4eded475ad9 upstream

The mutex will be used in subsequent changes to replace the busy looping of
a waiter when the futex owner is currently executing the exit cleanup to
prevent a potential live lock.
