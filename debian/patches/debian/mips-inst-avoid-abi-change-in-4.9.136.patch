Subject: mips: inst: Avoid ABI change in 4.9.136
Forwarded: not-needed

Commit cea8cd498f4f "MIPS: microMIPS: Fix decoding of swsp16 instruction"
changed the signed-ness (and name!) of a field of struct mm16_r5_format.
This indirectly changes the ABI of kprobes.  I don't think the change is
really that important, so hide it from genksyms.
