Subject: Revert "libata: Align ata_device's id on a cacheline"
Forwarded: not-needed

This reverts commit 740b87f7f34c4731301ae7e953a9f8c6a797e3c2, which
was commit 4ee34ea3a12396f35b26d90a094c75db95080baa upstream.  It's a
real fix but we've lived with the problem for many years and it
doesn't seem worth breaking ABI to fix it right now.
