Subject: [PATCH] futex: Clarify mark_wake_futex memory barrier usage
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.9/older/patches-4.9.30-rt20.tar.xz

Upstream commit 38fcd06e9b7f6855db1f3ebac5e18b8fdb467ffd

Clarify the scenario described in mark_wake_futex requiring the
smp_store_release(). Update the comment to explicitly refer to the
plist_del now under __unqueue_futex() (previously plist_del was in the
same function as the comment).
