Subject: [PATCH 114/347] sched: Limit the number of task migrations per batch
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=51223d1115c86430a7056acd7464cd8341a8a4dd

Put an upper limit on the number of tasks which are migrated per batch
to avoid large latencies.
