Subject: [PATCH 129/365] sched: Limit the number of task migrations per batch
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=d06f35b33128ae17f793d41aa28d24d1f7a6da2c

Put an upper limit on the number of tasks which are migrated per batch
to avoid large latencies.
