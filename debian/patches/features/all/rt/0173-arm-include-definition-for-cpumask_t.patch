Subject: [PATCH 173/337] arm: include definition for cpumask_t
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=39ab471329f05960ac4dd0178c84f181301ca5e1

This definition gets pulled in by other files. With the (later) split of
RCU and spinlock.h it won't compile anymore.
The split is done in ("rbtree: don't include the rcu header").
