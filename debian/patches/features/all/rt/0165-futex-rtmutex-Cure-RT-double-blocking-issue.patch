Subject: [PATCH 165/347] futex/rtmutex: Cure RT double blocking issue
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=851a5fabe377733427a073d7d6e1e886674f1a47

RT has a problem when the wait on a futex/rtmutex got interrupted by a
timeout or a signal. task->pi_blocked_on is still set when returning from
rt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock(). The task must acquire the hash bucket lock
after this.

If the hash bucket lock is contended then the
BUG_ON(rt_mutex_real_waiter(task->pi_blocked_on)) in
task_blocks_on_rt_mutex() will trigger.

This can be avoided by clearing task->pi_blocked_on in the return path of
rt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock() which removes the task from the boosting chain
of the rtmutex. That's correct because the task is not longer blocked on
it.
