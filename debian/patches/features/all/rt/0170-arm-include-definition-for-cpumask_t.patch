Subject: [PATCH 170/368] arm: include definition for cpumask_t
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.9/older/patches-4.9.178-rt131.tar.xz

This definition gets pulled in by other files. With the (later) split of
RCU and spinlock.h it won't compile anymore.
The split is done in ("rbtree: don't include the rcu header").
