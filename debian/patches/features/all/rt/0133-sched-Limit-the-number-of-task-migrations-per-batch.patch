Subject: [PATCH 133/351] sched: Limit the number of task migrations per batch
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=f8eb2be63f75f9b7b4090ddae4792a8b1fa883ab

Put an upper limit on the number of tasks which are migrated per batch
to avoid large latencies.
