Subject: [PATCH 167/365] arm: include definition for cpumask_t
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=75191ee81ec50eb8868f5d1033c14ee8588fdbf4

This definition gets pulled in by other files. With the (later) split of
RCU and spinlock.h it won't compile anymore.
The split is done in ("rbtree: don't include the rcu header").
