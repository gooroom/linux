Subject: drm/ast: Fix calculation of MCLK
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/6475a7cce61967fca4dd793b60acf5a7dc70bc9a
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/860900

Some braces were missing causing an incorrect calculation.

Y.C. Chen from Aspeed provided me with the right formula
which I tested on AST2400 and 2500.

The MCLK isn't currently used by the driver (it will eventually
to filter modes) so the issue isn't catastrophic.

Also make the printed value a bit more meaningful
