Subject: [PATCH 1/2] ARM: dts: orion5x-lschl: Fix model name
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/next/linux-next/c/d566a78ab13abded6b4acdc9b3fafa8c46f3ed09

Model name should be consistent with legacy device file, so that user
can migrate their system from legacy device support to device-tree
safely.

Legacy device file is currently removed, but it can be found on 4.8
or previous version of linux:
  arch/arm/mach-orion5x/ls-chl-setup.c

Fixes: f94f268979a2 ("ARM: dts: orion5x: convert ls-chl to FDT")
